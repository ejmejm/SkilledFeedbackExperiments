    <h1>What to expect next:</h1>
    
    <p> You are about to play 3 full rounds (each round has 2 lives/tries) of Pong. 
        The goal of the game is to bounce the ball past your opponents paddle to score goals
        without letting it pass by your paddle.
        To interact with the game you can use the up and down arrow keys to control your paddle. 
        There will also be an onscreen interface where you can click on the action you wish to take, 
        but use of a keyboard may be easier.</p>

    <p> Please play the game to the best of your ability.</p>
        
    <p> Please click "Submit" when you're ready to move on, and round 1 of 3 will begin.</p>
