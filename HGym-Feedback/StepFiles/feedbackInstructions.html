    <p> Now that you have finished playing the game, you will give live feedback to an AI
        that is playing the same game. This will again happen over 3 rounds of the game.
        Throughout the course of the game, there will be 2 feedback buttons you can press
        at anyime: positive and negative. The buttons can be clicked any number of times
        at any time during the game to let the AI know how it is doing. Note that there may be
        no visual changes when you click a feedback button, but the data will be logged.
        Please click the buttons to give feedback. The more frequent feedback is given the better. 
    </p>
        
    <p> Please click "Submit" when you're ready to move on, and feedback round 1 of 3 will begin.</p>
