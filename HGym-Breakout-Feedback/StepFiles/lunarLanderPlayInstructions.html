    <h1>What to expect next:</h1>
    
    <p> You are about to play 3 full rounds (each round has 2 lives/tries) of a game called Lunar Lander.
        The goal of the game is to safely land the spacecraft in between the flags on the ground. 
        The craft must land softly on its legs without crashing in order to score points. 
        To interact with the game you can hold the arrow keys to apply thrust to the spacecraft. 
        There will also be an onscreen interface where you can click on the action you wish to take, 
        but use of a keyboard may be easier.</p>

    <p> Please play the game to the best of your ability.</p>
        
    <p> Please click "Submit" when you're ready to move on, and round 1 of 3 will begin.</p>
